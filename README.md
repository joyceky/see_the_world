See the World

An exploratory photo map created by Kyle Joyce using the Google Maps API and the Flickr API.

See the World is a simple application. Either use your mouse or 2 fingers to scroll around the map and find a location you want to explore. Click or press on the location to see photos that Flickr users have geotagged.
